# GitCaller

This is a swift package currently in development. It is meant as a git bridge for swift, using git through shell, returning the result. Do not consider this as done. 

It is used by the project [GitBuddy](https://github.com/klein-artur/GitBuddy) in combination with [GitParser](https://github.com/klein-artur/GitParser).
